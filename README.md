# chess-shell

Chess shell allows you to play a game of chess or explore chess
problems (such as mate in three etc).  It implements the rules of
chess and evaluates the board position using a parallel alpha beta
algorithm.  Chess shell exploits the number of cores available unless
overridden by the user.  It uses a microcode and virtual processor to
apply and retract a move.
